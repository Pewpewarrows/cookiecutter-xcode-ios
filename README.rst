Unfamiliar with Cookiecutter? It's a simple tool which allows you to create new
projects from a starting template (like this one). In a few short seconds
you'll be ready to bring your idea to life, by building on top of the combined
knowledge and good practices of experts in your field.

This template is an excellent jump-off point for any iOS project. It has
strong, but justified opinions about how your project should be structured and
how your code should be written. It includes:

* Features!

Quick Start
-----------

Ensure that Cookiecutter is `installed
<http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_.

Make a directory for your new project and enter it. In this example we're
calling it "fancypants".

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir fancypants
    $ cd fancypants

Generate your initial code by using Cookiecutter with this template:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cookiecutter gh:Pewpewarrows/cookiecutter-xcode-ios

While it's generating everything, Cookiecutter will prompt you for certain
information, such as your full name, to customize the template for your
project.

Begin tracking the project in version control:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git init
    $ git add *
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
